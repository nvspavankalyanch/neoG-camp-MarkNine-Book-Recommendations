                    By Frank Herbert is a science fiction novel by Frank
                    Herbert, first published in 1965. It is set in the distant
                    future and tells the story of Paul Atreides, whose family is
                    given control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only known
                    source of the spice melange. The spice is a valuable
                    commodity and the key to space travel, making control of
                    Arrakis a highly coveted prize.

                  <small>
                    Book by W. Chan Kim and RenÃ©e Mauborgne that introduces the
                    concept of creating new market space, or a "blue ocean,"
                    rather than competing in a crowded, existing market, or a
                    "red ocean." The authors argue that companies can achieve
                    significant growth by focusing on creating and capturing new
                    demand rather than fighting for a share of existing demand.
